# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Ian Buchanan, Tony Chen, Filippos Kogiantis
       
# Intentions:

We seek to create a Python-based interpreter for the esoteric language Rockstar. 
    
# Intended usage:

The desired usage of this project is to be able to execute Rockstar code in a .rock file using a Python script. 
  
# Technical Details:

An esoteric language is a way to hide information from viewers who may not recognize that language. This is an example of steganography. 
This project will be split into tokenizing the data, identifying keywords, constructing a list of action dictionaries, and then interpreting actions like function definitions and variable definitions and loops. 

Tony will be responsible for tokenizing the data and working with variable definitions and loops.
Ian will be responsible for identifying keywords and constructing action dictionaries.
Filippos will be responsible interpreting actions and function definitions. 
    
# Intended pacing:

5/21 - tokenize lines 
5/22 - identify keywords 
5/23 - variable definition + printing + logic + arithmetic 
5/24 - loops 
5/25 - functions 
5/27 - arrays
