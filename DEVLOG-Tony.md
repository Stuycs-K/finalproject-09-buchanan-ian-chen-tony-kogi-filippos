### 2025-05-20 - Create helper functions
I coded a preprocessing function and a function that gets the next word in the code. 
I also started writing the main loop function that tokenizes everything called generate_tokens().

### 2025-05-21 - Add token generation for printing and variable assigning
I created if statements that would convert if statements and variable assigning into dictionaries that 
could be interpreted later. 

### 2025-05-22 - Worked on more variable assignments
Started writing code for "Put".
