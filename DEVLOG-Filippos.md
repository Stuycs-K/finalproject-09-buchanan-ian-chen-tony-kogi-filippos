### 2025-05-20 - finished brainstorming and researching
We looked at each of our project ideas and did research on how we would implement it.

### 2025-05-22 - wrote interpreter for 'let'
Looked over some code that Tony had written, and spent time to understand how 
the interpreter would work. I only had difficult understanding the dictionary structure.

### 2025-05-23 - finished let
found problems with my earlier version, and the find_word() function. Fixed that qwith ian.

### 2025-05-23 - finished at (arrays)
Spent some time researching on the rockstar website on how the array assignment works
Got it working for some basic sentences, but had to create a new type of dixtionary (since each assignemnt doesn't erase the other entries - it is unlike the standard variable assignment)
