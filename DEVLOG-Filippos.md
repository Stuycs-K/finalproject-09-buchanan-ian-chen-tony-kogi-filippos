## Filippos Kogiantis

### 2025-05-20 - finished brainstorming and researching
We looked at each of our project ideas and did research on how we would implement it.

### 2025-05-22 - wrote interpreter for 'let'
Looked over some code that Tony had written, and spent time to understand how 
the interpreter would work. I only had difficult understanding the dictionary structure.

### 2025-05-23 - finished let
found problems with my earlier version, and the find_word() function. Fixed that qwith ian.

### 2025-05-27 - finished at (arrays)
Spent some time researching on the rockstar website on how the array assignment works
Got it working for some basic sentences, but had to create a new type of dixtionary (since each assignemnt doesn't erase the other entries - it is unlike the standard variable assignment)

### 2025-05-28 - started working on rock array
Spent class period looking at "rock" which initializes arrays and documentation for it.
I got the dictionary working for simple cases, but had to create a new type for it.

### 2025-05-29 - initialize array with values
looked at more examples of initializing arrays, and discovered that you can initialize by placing values at an indice.
worked on the rock array part more, but didn't finish

### 2025-05-30 - more on rock array
tested my earlier functions and added more key words. I got stuck at this  part that
allows you to create an array within an array within an array within...
Basically got stuck on how to convert that into a dictioanry

### 2025-06-02 - started working on ninja strings
looked at documentation of ninja strings for a while, also to understand poetic numbers
I started writing something but I keep getting stuck when there is a kind of recursion involved
